Here are the Python solution for exercise sheet 2 on regression.

Current Notes: 
- Update Exercise sheets to also refer to python/sklearn
- Changed approach in Question 3: no DataFrame with powered x values, but use of predifined function np.polyfit and self-defined function for plotting polynomial --> self-defined function not computational efficent but dies it matter in this case?
- Intro in statsmodels.formula.api wanted?
- Right now only pure python code --> also Jupiter wanted? Or better solution for Latex compiling?
