\begin{enumerate}[a)]
  \item For the following situations, state whether you would rather expect 
  under- or overfitting behavior.
  \begin{enumerate}[i)]
    \item Large training set \& linear regression learner
    \item Noisy training data \& high-degree polynomial regression learner
    \item Few observations of many features \& linear regression learner
    \item Data with class overlap \& LDA learner
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Are overfitting and underfitting properties of a learner or of a 
  fixed model? Explain your answer.
  \item Should we aim to completely avoid both overfitting and underfitting?
\end{enumerate}
