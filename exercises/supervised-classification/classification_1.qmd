## Exercise 1: Logistic vs Softmax Regression

::: {.callout-tip icon=false title="This exercise is only for lecture group A"}
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Learning goals" icon=false}
TBD
:::

Binary logistic regression is a special case of multiclass logistic, or softmax, regression. The softmax function is the multiclass analogue to the logistic function, transforming scores $\thetab^\top \xv$ to values in the range [0, 1] that sum to one. The softmax function is defined as:

$$
\pi_k(\xv | \thetab) = \frac{\exp(\thetab_k^\top \xv)}{\sum_{j=1}^{g} \exp(\thetab_j^\top \xv)}, k \in \{1,...,g\}
$$

Show that logistic and softmax regression are equivalent for $g = 2$.

<!-- ::: {.panel-tabset} -->
As we would expect, the two formulations are equivalent (up to reparameterization). In order to see this, consider the softmax function components for both classes:

$$
\pi_1(\xv | \thetab) = \frac{\exp(\thetab_1^\top \xv)}{\exp(\thetab_1^\top \xv) + \exp(\thetab_2^\top \xv)}
$$

$$
\pi_2(\xv | \thetab) = \frac{\exp(\thetab_2^\top \xv)}{\exp(\thetab_1^\top \xv) + \exp(\thetab_2^\top \xv)}
$$

Since we know that $\pi_1(\xv | \thetab) + \pi_2(\xv | \thetab) = 1$, it is sufficient to compute one of the two scoring functions. Letâ€™s pick $\pi_1(\xv | \thetab)$ and relate it to the logistic function:

$$
\pi_1(\xv | \thetab) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(\thetab_2^\top \xv - \thetab_1^\top \xv)} = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-\thetab^\top \xv)}
$$

where $\thetab := \thetab_1 - \thetab_2$. Thus, we obtain the binary-case logistic function, reflecting that we only need one scoring function (and thus one set of parameters $\thetab$ rather than two $\thetab_1, \thetab_2$).

## Exercise 2: Hyperplanes

::: {.callout-tip icon=false title="This exercise is only for lecture group B"}
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Learning goals" icon=false}
TBD
:::

Linear classifiers like logistic regression learn a decision boundary that takes the form of a (linear) hyperplane. Hyperplanes are defined by equations $\thetab^\top \xv = b$ with coefficients $\thetab$ and a scalar $b \in \mathbb{R}$.

In order to see that such expressions actually describe hyperplanes, consider $\thetab^\top \xv = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_2 = 0$. Sketch the hyperplanes given by the following coefficients and explain the difference between the parameterizations:

- $\theta_0 = 0, \theta_1 = \theta_2 = 1$
- $\theta_0 = 1, \theta_1 = \theta_2 = 1$
- $\theta_0 = 0, \theta_1 = 1, \theta_2 = 2$

<summary>**Solution**</summary>

A hyperplane in 2D is just a line. We know that two points are sufficient to describe a line, 
so all we need to do is pick two points fulfilling the hyperplane equation.

- $\theta_0 = 0, \theta_1 = \theta_2 = 1$ $\rightsquigarrow$ e.g., (0, 0) and (1, -1). Sketch it:
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=3}
library(ggplot2)
p = ggplot(data.frame(x = c(0, 1), y = c(0, -1)), aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point(shape = "cross") +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = -1, linetype = 2) +
  xlim(c(-2, 2)) +
  ylim(c(-2, 2)) +
  labs(x = "x1", y = "x2") +
  theme_bw()
p
```

- $\theta_0 = 1, \theta_1 = \theta_2 = 1$ $\rightsquigarrow$ e.g., (0, -1) and (1, -2). The change in $\theta_0$ promotes a horizontal shift:
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=3}
library(ggplot2)
p = ggplot(data.frame(x = c(0, 1), y = c(0, -1)), aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point(shape = "cross") +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = -1, linetype = 2) +
  xlim(c(-2, 2)) +
  ylim(c(-2, 2)) +
  labs(x = "x1", y = "x2") +
  theme_bw()
q = p + geom_point(
  data.frame(x = c(0, 1), y = c(-1, -2)), 
  mapping = aes(x, y), 
  shape = "cross", 
  col = "red"
  ) +
  geom_abline(intercept = -1, slope = -1, col = "red", linetype = 2) 
q
```

- $\theta_0 = 0, \theta_1 = 1, \theta_2 = 2$ $\rightsquigarrow$ e.g., (0, 0) and (1, -0.5). The change in $\theta_2$ pivots the line around the intercept:
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=3}
library(ggplot2)
p = ggplot(data.frame(x = c(0, 1), y = c(0, -1)), aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point(shape = "cross") +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = -1, linetype = 2) +
  xlim(c(-2, 2)) +
  ylim(c(-2, 2)) +
  labs(x = "x1", y = "x2") +
  theme_bw()
q = p + geom_point(
  data.frame(x = c(0, 1), y = c(-1, -2)), 
  mapping = aes(x, y), 
  shape = "cross", 
  col = "red"
  ) +
  geom_abline(intercept = -1, slope = -1, col = "red", linetype = 2) 
r = q + geom_point(
  data.frame(x = c(0, 1), y = c(0, -0.5)), 
  mapping = aes(x, y), 
  shape = "cross", 
  col = "blue"
  ) +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = -0.5, col = "blue", linetype = 2) 
r
```

We see that a hyperplane is defined by the points that lie directly on it and thus fulfill the hyperplane equation.

## Exercise 3: Decision Boundaries & Thresholds in Logisitc Regression

::: {.callout-note title="Learning goals" icon=false}
TBD
:::

In logistic regression (binary case), we estimate the probability $P(y = 1 | \xv, \thetab) = \pi(\xv | \theta)$. In order to decide about
the class of an observation, we set $\hat{y} = 1$ iff $\pi(x | \theta) \geq \alpha\) for some \(\alpha \in (0, 1)$.

***
a) Show that the decision boundary of the logistic classifier is a (linear) hyperplane. Hint: derive the value of $\thetab^T\xv$ (depending on $\alpha$) starting from which you predict $\hat{y} = 1$ rather than $\hat{y} = 0$.

::: {.content-visible when-profile="solution"}
<details> 
<summary>**Solution**</summary>

We evaluate

$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{y} = 1 &\Leftrightarrow \pix = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-\thx)} \geq \alpha \\
&\Leftrightarrow\  1 + \exp(-\thx) \leq \frac{1}{\alpha} \\
&\Leftrightarrow\ \exp(-\thx) \leq \frac{1}{\alpha}  - 1 \\
&\Leftrightarrow\ -\thx \leq \log \left(\frac{1}{\alpha} - 1 \right) \\
&\Leftrightarrow\ \thx \geq -\log \left(\frac{1}{\alpha} - 1 \right).
\end{aligned}
$$

$\thx = -\log \left(\frac{1}{\alpha} - 1 \right)$ is the equation of the linear hyperplane comprised of all linear combinations $\thx$ that are equal to $-\log \left(\frac{1}{\alpha} - 1\right)$. The inequality therefore describes the decision rule for setting $\hat y$ equal to 1 by taking all points that lie on or above this hyperplane.

***
b) Below you see the logistic function for a binary classification problem with two input features for different values $\thetab = (\theta_1, \theta_2)$ (plots 1-3) as well as $\alpha$ (plot 4). What can you deduce for the values of $\theta_1$, $\theta_2$, and $\alpha$? What are the implications for classification in the different scenarios?

We observe

  - in plot (1): the logistic function runs parallel to the $x_2$ axis, so it is the same for every value of $x_2$. In other words, $x_2$ does not contribute anything to the class discrimination and its associated parameter $\theta_2$ is equal to 0.

  - in plot (2): both dimensions affect the logistic function -- to equal degree in this case, meaning $x_1$ and $x_2$ are equally important. If $\theta_1$ were larger than $\theta_2$ or vice versa the hypersurface would be more tilted towards the respective axis. Furthermore, due to $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ being positive, $\pix$ increases with higher values for $x_1$ and $x_2$.

  - in plot (3): this is the same situation as in plot (2) but the logistic function is steeper, which is due to $\theta_1, \theta_2$ having larger absolute values. We therefore get a sharper separation between classes (fewer predicted probability values close to 0.5, so we are overall more confident in our decision). As in plot (2), the increasing probability of $\hat{y}=1$ for higher values of $x_1$ and $x_2$ indicates positive values for $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$.

  - in plot (4): this is the same situation as in plot (1). The different values for $\alpha$ represent different thresholds: a high value (leftmost line) means we only assign class 1 if the estimated class-1 probability is large. Conversely, a low value (rightmost line) signifies we are ready to predict class 1 at a low threshold -- in effect, this is the same as the previous scenario, only the class labels are flipped. The mid line corresponds to the common case $\alpha = 0.5$ where we assign class 1 as soon as the predicted probability is more than 50%.

c) Derive the equation for the decision boundary hyperplane if we choose $\alpha = 0.5$.

::: {.content-visible when-profile="solution"}
<details> 
<summary>**Solution**</summary>
We make use of our results from a):

$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{y} = 1 &\Leftrightarrow \thx \geq -\log \left(\frac{1}{\alpha} - 1 \right) \\
&\Leftrightarrow \thx \geq -\log \left(\frac{1}{0.5} - 1 \right) \\
&\Leftrightarrow \thx \geq -\log 1 \\
&\Leftrightarrow \thx \geq 0.
\end{aligned}
$$

The 0.5 threshold therefore leads to the coordinate hyperplane and divides the input space into the positive "1" halfspace where $\thx \geq 0$ and the "0" halfspace where $\thx < 0$.

***
d) Explain when it might be sensible to set $\alpha$ to 0.5.

::: {.content-visible when-profile="solution"}
<details> 
<summary>**Solution**</summary>

When the threshold $\alpha = 0.5$ is chosen, the losses of misclassified observations, i.e., $L(\hat{y} = 0 ~|~ y = 1)$ and $L(\hat{y} = 1 ~|~ y = 0)$, are treated equally, which is often the intuitive thing to do. It means $\alpha = 0.5$ is a sensible threshold if we do not wish to avoid one type of misclassification more than the other. If, however, we need to be cautious to only predict class 1 if we are very confident (for example, when the decision triggers a costly therapy), it would make sense to set the threshold considerably higher.
