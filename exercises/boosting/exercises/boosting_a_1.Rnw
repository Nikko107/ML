Implement your own simple version of \texttt{AdaBoost} in R.
Use tree stumps from \texttt{rpart} as your base learner.\\
Compare your results with the \texttt{ada} function from the package \texttt{ada}.\\

\textbf{Hint:} \texttt{rpart} has a built-in weights option. 
To use it, add a weights column to your dataset and update it after each iteration.
