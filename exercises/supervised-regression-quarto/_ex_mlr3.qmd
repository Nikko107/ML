Throughout the lecture, we will frequently use the `R` package 
`mlr3`, resp. the `Python` package 
`sklearn`, and its descendants, providing an integrated ecosystem for all 
common machine learning tasks.
Let's recap the HRO principle and see how it is reflected in either `mlr3` or `sklearn`.
An overview of the most important objects and their usage, illustrated with 
numerous examples, can be found at [the `mlr3` book](https://mlr3book.mlr-org.com/basics.html) and
[the `scikit` documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html).

(@) How are the key concepts (i.e., hypothesis space, risk and optimization) 
  you learned about in the lecture videos implemented?

(@) Have a look at`mlr3::tsk("iris")` / `from sklearn.datasets import load_iris`. What attributes does this object store?

(@) Pick a module for classification or regression of your choice. What are the different settings for this learner?
  * `R` Hint: use `mlr3::mlr_learners\$keys()` to see all available learners.
  * `Python` Hint: Import the specific module and use `get_params()` to see all available settings.
