Assume the following (noisy) data-generating process from which we have 
observed 50 realizations: $$y = -3 + 5 \cdot 
\sin(0.4 \pi x) + \epsilon$$ with $\epsilon \, \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$.

(@) We decide to model the data with a cubic polynomial (including intercept 
  term). State the corresponding hypothesis space.
  
(@) State the empirical risk w.r.t. $\thetab$ for a member of the hypothesis 
  space. Use $L2$ loss and be as explicit as possible.


(@) We can minimize this risk using gradient descent.
Derive the gradient of the empirical risk w.r.t $\thetab$.
  
(@) Using the result for the gradient, state the calculation to update the current 
  parameter $\thetat$.

(@) You will not be able to fit the data perfectly with a cubic polynomial.
  Describe the advantages and disadvantages that a more 
  flexible model class would have. 
  Would you opt for a more flexible learner?
